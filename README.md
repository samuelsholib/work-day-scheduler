# work-day-scheduler
This repo is written to stablish a work day scheduler.
It's purpose is to help a busy client by simplifing his/her work into hours therefore, he/she knows what to do in every hours of each day.
When youclick into the timeblock, you will be able to enter an event for the given hour. 
Once you enter an event for the time-block and click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event will be saved in local storage.
As a result,  when you come back and refresh the page, you will be able to see the saved events.
The work-day-scheduler's color of each timeblock is coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
The time-block would show light-gray for past, Red for present, and green for future hours.
