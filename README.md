# work-day-scheduler
This repo is written to stablish a work day scheduler.
It's purpose is to help a busy client by simplifing his/her work into hours. Therefore, he/she knows what to do in every hours of each day.
When the client opens the scheduler,he/she will be displayed with the current day at the top of the calendar.
When they scroll down, they will be  presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
When client clicks into the timeblock, he/she will be able to enter an event for the given hour. 
Once the client enter an event for the time-block and click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event will be saved in local storage.
Therefor, when the client come back and refresh the page, they will be able to see the saved events.
The work-day-scheduler's color of each timeblock is coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
So, the time-block would show light-gray for past, Red for present, and green for future hours.
